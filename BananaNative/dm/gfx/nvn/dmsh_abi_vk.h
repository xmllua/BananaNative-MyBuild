// The Vulkan shader library ABI (Android): what the offline build (dm/gfx/tools/vk_android_build.py) and the Vulkan replay (dm/gfx/vk_android) agree on. The
// driver segment layout (c0 / c2 tables) and the binding kinds' meanings are dmsh_abi.h's; this file adds where each binding lands in Vulkan and the library's
// file format. android/SHADERS.md explains it.
// vk_android_build.py reads only the "#define DMSH_VK_<NAME> <value>" lines (hex or decimal integer, or a "string", an optional // comment after it); the structs
// below are for C. It is not part of DMSH_CHAIN (the Apple libraries do not depend on it); it is part of DMSH_VK_CHAIN (dmsh_chain_vk.h): after changing it, run
// vk_android_build.py --header and rebuild the Vulkan libraries.

// The library: <cache dir>/v-<DMSH_VK_CHAIN>/DMSH_VK_LIB_FILE, one file per game (index, binding records, module table, then the blob of SPIR-V words and c1 bytes).
// All integers little-endian. The replay maps the file and takes it when its header names the DMSH_CHAIN and DMSH_VK_CHAIN it was compiled with, or, while that
// version's library is being made, when its header's abi is the host's DMSH_VK_ABI (dmsh_chain_vk.h): the digest of this file and dmsh_abi.h without comments
// (vk_android_delta.py abi_digest), so an older library of the same ABI plays while its delta update runs (android/SHADERS.md#delta-updates)
// DMSH_VK_ABI_REV: raise it with any change of what the replay expects of a library or its modules that neither header shows (a convention in vk_android_spv.py or
