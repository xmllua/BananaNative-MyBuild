// The limit is the most image memory the device can hold without pushing the game or the system out of RAM, measured, not guessed: the images' own bytes plus what the
// process could still allocate (the smaller of Android's MemAvailable less a reserve and the image heap's budget, VK_EXT_memory_budget, less what else uses that heap), never
// under a floor, and no more than the images it holds while the system stalls on memory (vktl_pressure_limit). DM_VK_IMG_LIMIT_MB, when set, replaces it. Eviction is least recently used first and never takes an image used in the current or the previous frame: when
// everything over the limit is in use the cache stays over it (a working set larger than the limit would otherwise be uploaded again every frame: the thrash
// docs/reference/memory.md "Texture cache thrash" describes)
