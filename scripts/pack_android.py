#!/usr/bin/env python3
# A pack for the Android launcher (android/app) from a dumped game folder (the layout scripts/pack_dump.py reads: base/, updates/<version>/, dlc/).
# The pack holds what the host needs beside the game files and nothing the phone can read from the game folder itself:
#   <module>.patched.bin, <module>.fixups.tsv, <module>.gates.tsv and the rewriter's other tables, for every module of the profile, rewritten with patch_nso.py --target android
#   game.tsv     the profile the host was built with (for reference: the host has it compiled in)
#   pack.tsv     what the launcher reads: title ID, version, build IDs, and the RomFS and DLC folders relative to the game folder; the shader library's path in the pack
#   shaders/v-<DMSH_VK_CHAIN>/dmsh_vk.lib, inputs.tsv   the game's shaders as SPIR-V for the Vulkan replay (dm/gfx/tools/vk_android_build.py; android/SHADERS.md), the library
#                of this source tree's version: an up-to-date one in the shader cache is copied, else it is built from the Switch shader package
#   build_src.sha256, rewrite_<module>.log
# The RomFS is not in the pack (the app gives the host <game folder>/<romfs> as DM_ROMFS) and neither is anything else of the dump but the rewritten code.
# The game may be a NUP file instead of a folder (android/NUP.md): its packages are read in place (pack_dump.scan, dm/tools/nup.py), the modules and the RomFS are
# named `<name>.nup:update/<version>/...` (or `:base/...`), the DLC `<name>.nup:addon/<title ID>/romfs`, and pack.tsv's paths are relative to the folder holding the file.
# Writes <game folder>/../<title ID>-work/android-pack/ unless --out names another folder. A repeat run keeps modules whose inputs are unchanged.
# Needs Python with Capstone 5 and lz4 (pyproject.toml, dependency group android-pack). Packs are for the user's own phone: never commit or share one.
# The shader library: <work>/android-shaders/lib/v-<V>/ is reused when its inputs.tsv names this game and its profile's current inputs (a full build writes it last);
# otherwise it is built there from <work>/android-shaders/pkg (shader_split.py's output, as dmsh_build.py takes) by vk_android_build.py, which needs Python 3.14 (or
# backports.zstd), the .NET 10 runtime and spirv-val: --shader-python names that Python (default: the first of python3.14 / python3 on PATH that has zstd). About 10 minutes
# on DKB with -J 12. Without a package (the default folder or --shader-pkg) the dump is split into it first (split_shaders), and the split must hold every shader of the
# profile's shader_map.tsv; vk_android_build.py reads each shader from the package by its key, so a package of another split (base, update and DLC RomFS together) builds the
# same library and one that lacks a shader stops the build. --no-shaders leaves them out.
# --in-process (the phone's packer, android/ONDEVICE.md: an app may not start programs, and its process must not fork): the rewriter runs in this Python, one module after the other
# (runpy, with DM_REWRITE_J=1), and the shader library is not built here (it must be current in the cache, or --no-shaders).
# Each module is rewritten into <out>/.rewrite-<module>/ and moved into the pack when complete, its <module>.android.key last (a module without its key is
# unfinished: the launcher refuses it, the next run rewrites it). Libraries of other versions in the pack's shaders/ are kept.
# --code-only rewrites the modules and stops (pack.tsv, game.tsv and the shaders untouched); --keep-code packs without rewriting (the phone's two steps).
# Usage: pack_android.py <game folder | .nup file> [--version N] [--out DIR] [-j N] [--shader-cache DIR] [--shader-pkg DIR] [--shader-python PY] [-J N] [--no-shaders] [--code-only | --keep-code] [--in-process]   (exit 1 on error)
