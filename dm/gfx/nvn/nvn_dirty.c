// released first, as a host write would (stamped: its textures upload again), and g_slot_mu stays held, so nvn_dirty_protect waits until the swap ends. With no page of
// the range protected, the fault and pre-write paths change nothing there. The holder must not wait for anything that waits on nvn_dirty_protect's callers

// have made one: from here on new splits land only on the coarse boundaries. Pages already protected stay as they are; the next protection or release of a block takes
// the whole coarse block. Returns the block size in force (0 = by the page: the tracker has not started)
